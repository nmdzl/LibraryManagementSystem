1. Now nobody can borrow a special collection now. Instead, wait for admin's approve.
2. Remove the Librarian row in librarians show page.
3. Librarians show page now correctly shows the name of library instead of library_id.
4. A new functionality added, that request for a special collection must be approved by admin so that a student can check out it. But there is still a routing error, please fix it.
